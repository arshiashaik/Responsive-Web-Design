In school, you might have learned that red, yellow, and blue are primary colors, and learned how to create new colors by mixing those. However, this is an outdated model.

These days, there are two main color models: the <b>additive RGB (red, green, blue) model used in electronic devices</b>, and <b>the subtractive CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) model used in print</b>. In this project you'll work with the RGB model.

We learned that the RGB color model is additive. This means that colors begin as black, and change as different levels of red, green, and blue are introduced.

Each red, green, and blue value is a number from 0 to 255. 0 means that there's 0% of that color, and is black. 255 means that there's 100% of that color.

A very common way to apply color to an element with CSS is with hexadecimal or hex values. While hex values sound complicated, they're really just another form of RGB values.

Hex color values start with a # character and take six characters from 0-9 and A-F. The first pair of characters represent red, the second pair represent green, and the third pair represent blue. For example, #4B5320.

The HSL color model, or hue, saturation, and lightness, is another way to represent colors.

The CSS hsl function accepts 3 values: a number from 0 to 360 for hue, a percentage from 0 to 100 for saturation, and a percentage from 0 to 100 for lightness.

If you imagine a color wheel, the hue red is at 0 degrees, green is at 120 degrees, and blue is at 240 degrees.

Saturation is the intensity of a color from 0%, or gray, to 100% for pure color.

Lightness is how bright a color appears, from 0%, or complete black, to 100%, complete white, with 50% being neutral.
